Preliminary remarks
This manual serves at the same time as a Reference manual and as a User Guide for the comis system.
Historically the following IHEP (Institute for High Energy Physics, Moscow Region, Russia) people
have worked on the comis system: V. Bereshnoi, S. Nikitin, Y. Petrovych and V. Sikolenko. At CERN
René Brun has contributed to the development of the system.
In this manual examples are in monotype face and strings to be input by the user are underlined. In
the index the page where a routine is defined is in bold, page numbers where a routine is referenced are
in normal type.
In the description of the routines a * following the name of a parameter indicates that this is an output
parameter. If another * precedes a parameter in the calling sequence, the parameter in question is both
an input and output parameter.

Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 comis - What is it ?
comis (a COMpilation and Interpretation System) is a Fortran interpreter. With comis you can interactively define, edit and execute any Fortran-like routines (e.g., consisting of one simple output statement),
without recompiling and relinking. A small user interface system is part of comis, and an interface with
the local editor is also provided.
comis is one of the key components of the paw system and is currently implemented on IBM VM/CMS,
VAX/VMS, Apollo (Aegis and Unix), IBM RS/6000, DEC Station 3100, Silicon Graphics, Sun, HP/UX
and MSDOS. It can also be used as an interactive compiler and interpreter from inside a Fortran 77
program. If the source of your program to be compiled is in a file IFORT.FOR then you should use the
following code:

Example of calling comis from within Fortran
PROGRAM MAIN
CALL HLIMIT(10000)
CALL CSINIT(2000)
1 CALL CSPAUS(’IFORT’)
GO TO 1
END
$ Fortran IFORT
$ link IFORT,’LIB$’
$ run IFORT
You can run the simple example below by typing the lines below in response to the comis prompt “CS>”:
DO 1 X=3.14, -3.14,-0.7
PRINT *,X,SIN(X)
1 CONTINUE
END
or the same code in short notation as: DO X=3.14, -3.14,-0.7 PRINT *,X,SIN(X) OD #
The sequence STOP END will cause exit from comis.

1.2 comis at a glance
comis is a library of routines written in Fortran 77. A few routines exist also in assembler on IBM.
comis has two major components:
– A set of subroutines to interactively compile and execute Fortran-like routines.
– A package of subroutines, handling the interface between the user’s routines compiled with the
normal Fortran compiler and those compiled interactively.
The comis system supports the following facilities:
1

2

Chapter 1. Introduction
–
–
–
–

The interpretation of comis routines entered either interactively or through text files.
The ability to call any user routine from the comis program and vice versa.
The access to user COMMON blocks data from the comis program.
The ability to redefine any comis program.

1.3 comis with PAW
A high level interface to comis is provided by paw. The PAW user creates and edit text files containing
Fortran code using the local editor. These files are automatically interpreted and executed by the PAW
commands without typing any comis commands. From the PAW level comis may be invoked in one of
the three following ways:
– Using a comis command. Example:
PAW > comis
CS >
do x=1.,10.
MND>
sq=sqrt(x)*10.
MND>
print *,x,sq
MND>
od
MND>
end
CS > quit
PAW >
– Using an APPLication command. Example:
PAW > Vector/Create Y(10) r 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
PAW > APPLication comis QUIT
CS >
subroutine demo
FSD>
vector y, x(10)
FSD>
do 10 i=1,10
FSD>
xx=i
FSD>
x(i)=y(i)*sqrt(xx)*10.
FSD> 10 continue
FSD>
end
CS >
call demo
MND>
end
CS > quit
PAW> Vector/print X
– Using a CALL command: CALL urout.
– Case 1:
urout is a routine compiled and linked with paw, for example HPRINT. Then one can type
CALL HPRINT(10)
– Case 2:
urout is the name of a file which can be edited interactively with the paw EDIT command.
For example if the file UROUT.FOR contains:
SUBROUTINE UROUT(N)

1.3. comis with PAW

10

SUM=0.
DO 10 I=1,N
SUM=SUM+I
CONTINUE
PRINT *,SUM
END

Then one can type CALL UROUT.FOR(10).
PAW users are recommended to use the standard Fortran notation and to read the following chapter to be
aware of the few comis restrictions.

Chapter 2: The comis compiler
This chapter gives a brief description of the comis syntax. Only the main differences between the comis
syntax and standard Fortran 77 will be discussed.
The comis system language is an almost full implementation of Fortran 77. As the user is working in a
realtime environment, some simplifications of the language syntax (in addition to the standard one) are
also available: short forms for key-words (CHAR instead of CHARACTER and so on) and a free source code
format.
The main differences between the comis syntax and standard Fortran77 are:
– comis does not accept:
–
–
–
–
–

character functions;
statement functions;
INTRINSIC statements;
ENTRY statements;
BLOCK DATA statements.

– comis does not allow a character type variable to be equivalenced with another character variable.
– A type declaration statement, which define the data type of common block name’s, must precede
the COMMON statement.
– The logical operators .EQV. and .NEQV. are not included in comis.
– comis does not allow a character expression and an alternate return specifiers as actual arguments.

2.1

The source format

The comis source code is essentially free format. Extensions are:
– Statements may start at any position.
– More than one statement may be given per source line. In this case they should be separated by
blank(s), or optionally by ’;’.
– A statement may occupy more than one source line without any special marks.
– Source lines may be up to 80 characters long. Thus, source line numbering in columns 73-80 is
not available.
– A symbolic name is a string of letters, digits and underscore (_). The symbolic name may have
any length, but significant characters are the first eight only.

Note
– Blanks are meaningful in comis.
– Comment lines are marked by ’*’ or ’C’ in column one. An exclamation mark (!) starts an inline
comment, except when it appears as the first non-blank character on a line.
– Some extentions may cause a conflict with the conventions of Fortran 77 (see the !FORTRAN
directive in Chapter 4).

2.2. Data types and constants

2.2

Data types and constants

The following data types are supported:
INTEGER, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION, LOGICAL, CHARACTER, COMPLEX
There are seven types of constants: Integer, Real, Double precision, Logical, Complex, Character string
and Hollerith.
Constants may be placed directly in the source code, or they can be accessed by names assigned to them
with PARAMETER statements.

2.3

Declarations

Data type declarations
full form
--------INTEGER
REAL
DOUBLE PRECISION
LOGICAL
CHARACTER
CHARACTER*(*)
CHARACTER *n
COMPLEX

short form
---------INT
REAL
DOUBLE
LOG
CHAR
CHAR*(*)
CHAR *n
COMPLEX

DIMENSION statement
In F77 the upper bound of the last dimension may be specified as ’*’. comis does not allow it.

EQUIVALENCE statement or EQU
The short form of this statement is EQU.
In F77 a character type variable may be equivalenced with another character variable. comis does not
allow this.

DATA statement
In F77 named common blocks may be initialized by means of a DATA statement in a BLOCK DATA
subprogram. comis does not support BLOCK DATA subprogram, but DATA statement may be used to
initialize common blocks in any comis routines.
Note that comis does not support an implied DO list in a DATA statement to initialize the elements of
an array.

IMPLICIT statement or IMP
This statement is the same as the standard one. comis supports the IMPLICIT NONE statement also.

6

Chapter 2. The comis compiler

SAVE statement
All data are saved in comis .
In F77 a named common block name (preceded and followed by a slash) is allowed in SAVE lists. comis
does not allow this.

INTRINSIC statement
This statement is at present not supported by comis.

COMMON statement or COM
This statement is the same as the standard one.
The COMMON statement defines the position and the order of the user’s variables and/or arrays in
storage . The common block with the same name must be present in the application program (see also
section 3.3).

USE statement
USE list
In any comis routines one can have access to variables’ names, defined in COMMON declarations in the
main comis program (see section 2.5.1). This can be done by the USE statement, in which one should
declare the names of a corresponding COMMON block. The name BLANK$ should be declared in the list
for access to variable names of a non labeled COMMON.

VECTOR statement
This statement can be used in a paw version of comis only.
The declaration VECTOR vector_name may be used inside a comis routine to address a kuip vector. If
the vector does not exist, it is created with the specifications provided by the declared dimension. The
vectors x and y defined in the example on page 2 show how this works.

2.4

Other language elements

2.4.1

Arithmetic, logical and character string expressions

The following operations are available:
+ - * /
.LT.
or
.LE.
or
.EQ.
or
.NE.
or
.GE.
or
.GT.
or
.OR. .AND.

** //

The logical operators .EQV. and .NEQV. are not included in comis.

2.4. Other language elements

2.4.2

7

Control statements

Loops
DO loops with index and DO WHILE (logical expression) constructions are provided. Loops may have the
DO-ENDDO or DO-OD forms or may be labeled in a Fortran-like manner. For the indexed loops the index
may be of an integer or a real type only.

2.4.3

IF statements

comis supports both the standard F77 syntax and a form ending in FI for the IF statement.
IF...[ELSEIF]...[ELSE]...ENDIF
or
IF...[ELESIF]...[ELSE]...FI

GOTO statements or GO
Jumps to constant labels, assigned GOTOs in connection with ASSIGN statements, and computed GOTOs are provided.
F77 allows the use of a list with optional labels on an assigned GOTO statement; this facility is not
supported in comis.

CALL statement
This statement calls a user or a comis routine.
comis supports three forms of the CALL statement:
1.
2.
3.1
3.2

CALL subr_name [( arg_list)]
subr_name ( arg_list)
subr_name arg_list
subr_name;

where subr_name is the name of the subroutine which may be:
– an already defined comis routine;
– a user supplied routine: if no comis routine with the specified name is found, then comis will
search for a user routines with that name (see also section 3.3).
The semi-colon character “;” is significant in case 3.2 above!

INCLUDE directive
An INCLUDE directive is available and has one of the following forms:
1.
2.

INCLUDE ’name’
INCLUDE name

8

Chapter 2. The comis compiler

When name is given between quotes (case 1. above), then the name is taken literally, while in case 2.
the string name is converted to uppercase.
Note that comis does not allow recursive INCLUDE directives.

2.4.4

Other statements

CONTINUE

the short form of this statement is CON

RETURN

the short form of this statement is RET

QUIT

return from comis to application program

END

the short form of this statement is “#”

2.4.5

Input/output statements

The full set of F77 input/output statements is implemented. comis provides four types of input/output
statements:
–
–
–
–

Sequential input/output statements
Direct access input/output statements
List directed input/output statements
Internal data set input/output statements.

A list of comis input/output source statements follows:
OPEN, WRITE, PRINT, READ, ENDFILE, BACKSPACE, REWIND, CLOSE, INQUIRE.
The comis extentions are:
– INPUT statement - input from a terminal in free format.
– TYPE statement - output to a terminal in free format.

FORMAT statement
The FORMAT statement has the form:
FORMAT( f1 [,f2 [,...,fn]])
where f1,f2,...,fn are format codes.
The current version of comis does not support kP, S, SP, SS, BN and BZ edit descriptors.
The length of a format specification cannot exceed 256 characters.

INQUIRE statement
The INQUIRE statement has one of the forms:
INQUIRE(dsns,iflist)
INQUIRE( ns,iflist)

9

2.4. Other language elements
dsns

data set name specifier of the form FILE= dsn;

ns

data set reference number of the form UNIT= ns;

iflist

list as defined in Fortran 77.

You cannot omit UNIT=ns on a comis inquire statement.

INPUT statement or INP
The INPUT statement has the form
INPUT list
This statement inputs values from the terminal; the user is prompted with the list element name. If the
user press a carriage return key, the current value is not changed, otherwise the constant typed in becomes
the new value of a list element. If a list element value is a constant then this constant is simply typed out.

TYPE statement
The TYPE statement has the form
TYPE list
This statement types values of the lists elements in free format.
Example:
If the user runs the next simple comis program:
CHARACTER A*4
J=1
INPUT ’CHARACTER *4’,A, ’J HAS VALUE 1’,J,Z
TYPE A,J,Z
END
The dialogue will be
’CHARACTER*4’
*C A=abcd<cr>
’J HAS VALUE 1’
*I J=<cr>
*R Z=3.14<cr>
*T A = ABCD

J = 1

Z = 3.140000

10

Chapter 2. The comis compiler

2.5

Programs

2.5.1

Main program

The comis main program syntax is:
[PROGRAM name]
[Declaration statements]
[Executable statements]
END
The main program is executed immediately whenever its definition is finished. The comis system “remembers” all declarations of common blocks issued in the main program. These declarations should not
be repeated each time the main program is redefined.
Moreover these declarations are valid for other subprograms through the USE statement (see section 2.3)
This does not mean that you cannot enter the new COMMON declarations during the main program
redefinition.

2.5.2

Functions and subroutines

The colon character “:” is the short form of key words FUNCTION and SUBROUTINE. Actual arguments may be constants, variables, arithmetic expressions, arrays, arrays elements or subroutines names.
comis does not allow a character expression and alternate return specifiers as an actual arguments.
The comis extensions are:
– The number of routine’s arguments may vary and can be obtained inside the called routine.
– An argument can be a sequence of statements enclosed in square brackets.
– An argument can be omited.
For details see Appendix B.
comis does not accept statement functions, functions of a character type and an ENTRY statement.
The full set of intrinsic functions supplied in the comis system excepting CHAR, LLT, LLE, LGT,
LGE.

Chapter 3: Calling sequences
This chapter describes the comis interface with a user and his application program.

3.1

Initialization

The first action to perform is to initialize the comis system variables by calling:
CALL CSINIT

(NWORDS)

where the input parameter NWORDS is the size of the system common block
COMMON /COMIS/CS(NWORDS)
By default NWORDS=2000, which is usually sufficient.

3.2

Entry to comis

The three routines described in this section can be used for this purpose:
CALL CSPAUS

(ENTRY_PROMPT)

where ENTRY_PROMPT is a character string. In this case comis types the ENTRY_PROMPT and the dialogue
is started.
CALL CSTEXT

(ENTRY_PROMPT,TEXT)

where input parameters ENTRY_PROMPT and TEXT are characters strings. In this case comis interprets
the string “TEXT”, types ENTRY_PROMPT and starts the dialogue.
CALL CSEXEC

(TEXT,IERR*)

where input parameter TEXT is a character string. In this case comis interprets the given string “TEXT”
only and control is returned to the calling routine. The output parameter IERR is zero when no errors are
encountered, non-zero otherwise.
During the dialogue session comis gives the standard prompt “CS>” and the user can:
– enter the system directives( see Chapter 4);
– enter the function or the subroutine definition;
– enter the comis main program.
All system directives are executed immediately and the prompt “CS>” is displayed again.
If the FUNCTION or the SUBROUTINE statement is entered, comis changes his prompt to “FSD>”
until the END statement completes the routine definition. An intermediate code is stored in the internal
buffer and comis gives the prompt “CS>”.
During the main program definition comis uses the prompt “MND>”. The comis linker is invoked automatically if the compilation was error-free. The linker tries to resolve references in the order: comis
routines; user’s routines. After this stage the main program executes and comis types the entry prompt
and gives the standard prompt “CS>”.
11

12

Chapter 3. Calling sequences

A comis built-in editor (see Chapter 5) is automatically invoked when a syntax error is detected. The
command “E” of the editor causes the recompilation of the text edited and then the dialogue is continued.
The command “Q” of the editor causes the current routine definition to be skipped and comis gives the
prompt “CS>”.
The exit from the comis dialogue session is performed by the RETURN statement in the main program
or by an “empty” (END or # ) main program definition. For exiting from any comis routine to an
application program the QUIT statement can be used.

3.3

Calling the user routines

In order to invoke the routines compiled by the user comis has to know the address of the called routine.
The location of the routine can be passed to the comis interpreter through a call to subroutine CSEXT:
CALL CSEXT

(’name1.type,...,nameN.type#’,name1,...,nameN)

where name1,...,nameN should be declared as EXTERNAL in the Fortran program. Possible values
for the .type specifier are:
D

for a double precision function;

I

for an integer function;

L

for a logical function;

R

for a real function;

S

for a subroutine;

X

for a complex function.

If the type specifier is omitted, then type subroutine (’.S’) is assumed.
Data transmission between Fortran and comis routines is done in the usual way using routine parameters
and through COMMON blocks. To handle COMMON blocks the interpreter has to know the address of
the first element of each such block. This is specified by using subroutine CSCOM as follows:
CALL CSCOM

(’name1,...,nameN#’,FE1,...,FEN)

FE1,...,FEN are the first elements of the COMMON blocks with names name1,...,nameN. The name
$BLANK should be used for the blank COMMON.
The addresses of COMMON blocks which contain character data should be specified with a call to
routine CSCOMC, whose calling sequence is similar to CSCOM.

3.4

Calling comis routines from a user program

The user can call a comis routine from a Fortran77 program using the routine’s name or address. The
second call is faster, but it requires the preliminary calculation of the address by
JADP=CSADDR(’NAME’)

Arithmetic parameters
This section describes routines and functions which can be used for calling comis subroutines and functions which have only arithmetic parameters.

13

3.4. Calling comis routines from a user program
Calling a comis subroutine
CALL CSCALL (’NAME’,NPAR,P1,P2,...) and

CALL CSJCAL (JADP,NPAR,P1,P2,...)

where
NAME

is the name of the called comis routine;

JADP

is the address of the called comis routine;

NPAR

is the number of arguments;

P1,P2,...are the routine’s actual arguments.

Using integer comis functions
I

= CSICAL (’NAME’,NPAR,P1,P2,...) and

= CSIJCL (JADP,NPAR,P1,P2,...)

I

Using real comis functions
R

= CSRCAL (’NAME’,NPAR,P1,P2,...) and

R

= CSRJCL (JADP,NPAR,P1,P2,...)

To speed up execution three special functions are available for the case of routines with one, two and
three arguments:
R = CSR1FN(JADP,P1)
R = CSR2FN(JADP,P1,P2)
R = CSR3FN(JADP,P1,P2,P3)

Using double precision comis functions
D

= CSDCAL (’NAME’,NPAR,P1,P2,...) and

D

= CSDJCL (JADP,NPAR,P1,P2,...)

Using complex comis functions
Cx

= CSCCAL (’NAME’,NPAR,P1,P2,...) and

Cx

= CSCJCL (JADP,NPAR,P1,P2,...)

General parameters
This section describes routines and functions which can be used for calling comis subroutines and functions which can have any type of parameters.
Calling a comis subroutine
CALL CSSUBR (STR,P1,P2,...) and

CALL CSJSUB (JADP,STR1,P1,P2,...)

where STR and STR1 are character strings which specifies the name of called comis routines and the type
of each parameters in argument list.

The parameters STR and STR1 in these routines have the forms
STR

name (parameter type description)

STR1

(parameter type description)

where “name” is the name of the comis routine which is called; “(parameters types description)”
specifies the type of each parameter in the argument list.
Examples:
STR = ’NAME(I,R,D,C,E,*12)’

XYZ-expressions

comis supports a special class of XYZ-expressions. The XYZ-expression uses only the variable names
X and/or Y and/or Z, e.g.
X+Y+Z

or X**2+Z**2

or SIN(Y)**2+COS(Y)**2

An XYZ-expression can be translated by
CALL CSEXPR

(XYZexpr,JADDR)

where XYZexpr is an argument of type character, whose contents is an XYZ-expression, JADDR is the
address of an XYZ-expression stored in the comis internal buffer.
The XYZ-expression can be evaluated by
VAL = CSRJCL(JADDR,NPAR,ARG1,ARG2,ARG3)
using the standard way to call a comis real function.
If X is omitted in the XYZ-expression then ARG1 must be a dummy argument, if Y is omitted then ARG2
must be a dummy argument, e.g.
XYZ-expression
SIN(Y)/Y
X+Z
Z**2
X**2

can be evaluated by
V
V
V

=

CSRJCL(JADDR,2,dummy,Y)
CSRJCL(JADDR,3,X,dummy,Z)
CSRJCL(JADDR,3,dummy,dummy,Z)
CSRJCL(JADDR,1,X)

Chapter 4: System directives
Some of the directives listed below have the optional parameter “LUN”. It is the logical unit number for
input/output streams. If this parameter is omitted, the default value is used (see appendix A). All comis
directives start with a special character ”!” to avoid a conflict with user defined routines.
!HELP

This directive ouputs to terminal short help about directives.
!FILE

[lun,] file_name

By default the system input device is the terminal. This directive sets the input stream to the file
file_name. The same action can be performed in a user routine by calling:
CALL CSOFIL (lun,’file_name’) and

CALL CSFILE (’file_name’)

The system switches to the terminal again when the file is read or an !EOF directive is reached.
!EOF

This directive closes the input file. The next string will be accepted from the terminal.
!LOGFILE

[lun,] file_name

The transcript of the interactive session will be collected in the file file_name. This file can be used
in the FILE directive later (to repeat the same dialogue session, for example). The same action can be
performed in a user routine by calling:
CALL CSOLOG (lun,’file_name’) and

CALL CSLOG (’file_name’)

!FORTRAN

This directive sets the mode of compilation to “Fortran”. This mode should be selected avoid syntactic
conflicts when you want to process standard Fortran sources with the comis compiler. After getting this
directive the compiler treats a ’C’ character in the first column as a comment mark and every character
in the sixth column as a continuation mark (unlike comis’ free format syntax). This mode is the default.
!COMIS

This directive sets the “COMIS” mode of compilation.
!SHELL

command

passes an operand line to the operating system for command processing. Does not cause a break.
!SHOW

memory

This directive shows the comis internal memory usage.
!SHOW

routines

This directive shows a list of routines currently known to comis.
17

18
!SHOW

Chapter 4. System directives
commons

This directive shows list of common and global blocks currently known to comis.
!SHOW

names common_name

This directive shows declaration of common or global block with name common_name.
!REMOVE

cs_routine_name

This directive removes from the internal comis memory the comis routine with name cs_routine_name.
!CLEAR

This directive clears the internal comis memory: it removes all comis routines and all common/global
blocks declarations.
!CHECKB

When the directive CHECKB is given comis will check during routines interpretation that the evaluated
result of a array’s subscript expression is greater than or equal to the corresponding lower dimension
bound and does not exceed the corresponding upper dimension bound.
!NOCHECKB

The directive NOCHECKB causes no check to be made during routines interpretation (default is CHECKB).
!PARAM

The directive PARAM causes the comis compiler to insert additional code to provide all facilities for the
treatment of actual arguments.
!NOPARAM

With the directive NOPARAM you cannot obtain the argument’s text and the Algol like manner of argument
processing is not available (default is NOPARAM).

Chapter 5: Built-in editor
comis provides a built-in editor which is automatically invoked by the interpreter when an error is
detected. The comis built-in editor is similar to the VAX line-mode EDIT/EDT. A line can be referenced
by its line number. The INSERT and DELETE commands change a the line numbering. To operate on a
set of lines it is possible to specify a line range in the following forms:
N1:N2

specifies the set of lines from N1 to N2, where N1<N2 or N1>N2.

N

specifies N-th line from the beginning of the file.

+N

specifies +N-th line from the current pointer position.

-N

specifies -N-th line from the current pointer position.

The character “F” is recognized as the first line of the routine and the character “L” is recognized as its
last line; “W” is recognized as “F:L”.

5.1
T

Commands explanation
[range]

This command types the lines in the given range. If range is omitted the current line is typed. The
leading T can be omitted and only the range specified. In response to a <CR> the next line is typed.
S/old/new/

[range]

This command substitutes the “old” text string by the “new” one for all lines in the range.
D

[range]

This command deletes the set of lines specified (the line numbers will be changed).
I

[line_number]/ line1<CR> line2<CR>...<lineN>/

This command inserts the given text lines after the line specified by the line_number. To insert new
lines at the very beginning you should specify line_number=0 (the line numbers will be changed ).
EXIT

This command cause exits from the editor. The text is processed by the comis compiler automatically.
QUIT

This command cause exits from the editor without any compilation.
EDIT

comis invokes the local editor of the operating system. After edit session control is returned to the
built-in editor.
HELP

This command types HELP information about the editor commands.
19

Appendix A: Input/Output unit numbers
For input/output streams comis uses the following channels by default:
channel

usage

lunsn =11

for the system’s needs.

lunfil=12

for input source code under the !FILE directive.

lunlog=13

for output into the LOG-file.

lunmap=14

for access to the MAP-file.

lunedt=15

for the local editor

One can change the default values by
CALL CSSETL

(lunsn,lunfil,lunlog,lunmap,lunedt)

before comis system initialization.
In the case of PAW, these defaults have been changed to 81,82,83,84,85 respectively.

Appendix B: Obtaining the values of actual arguments
A group of routines to handle actual arguments is provided by comis. These routines allow the user
– to obtain the number of actual arguments;
– to obtain the type and the mode of each argument;
– to get the value or execute argument’s code.
These routines can be used at the comis level or at the Fortran one, if the user’s routine was called from
the comis level.
The number of actual arguments, NPAR, can be obtained with:
NPAR

= CSNPAR

(DUMMY)

The type and mode of the K-th argument can be obtained by:
IT = CSKPAR

(K,MODE)

where
IT=0
1
2
3
4
5
6

unknown
integer
real
character
logical
double precision
Hollerith

MODE=0

4
5
6
7
8
9

unknown
expression
constant
variable
array element
function call
array name
external
[sequence of statements]
omitted (empty) argument

The value of the Kth argument or the execution of its code is obtained by:
CALL CSCPAR

(K)

In fact this subroutine fills the system COMMON block CSWPAR, whose definition is described below:
DOUBLE PRECISION DVPAR
COMMON/CSWPAR/LORN,IREP,NPAR,ITPAR,MDPAR,JRESP,JCHPAR,NCHPAR,IVPAR,RVPAR,DVPAR,JCHVP,NCHVP
where
LORN

is set by the user. It specifies the manner of argument processing:
0
1

IREP

ordinary Fortran-like processing, i.e. the value of the argument is taken immediately using
the argument address.
ALGOL-like processing “by name”: the argument is re-evaluated as if it was in the routine’s text at that point.

the reply word: 1 - o.k.; less or equal 0 - error.
21

22

Appendix B. Obtaining the values of actual arguments

NPAR

the number of actual arguments.

ITPAR

the type of the argument.

MDPAR

the mode of the argument .

JRESP

the address of the argument’s value.

JCHPAR

the ’character’ address

NCHPAR

the length of the argument’s text.

IVPAR

the integer value of the argument.

RVPAR

the real value of the argument.

DVPAR

the double precision value of the argument.

JCHVP

the ’character’ address

NCHVP

the length of the character type argument.

To obtain the value of the integer type argument the next integer function may be used:
I = CSIPAR

(K)

To obtain the value of the real type argument the next function may be used:
R = CSRPAR

(K)

These two latter functions call subroutine CSCPAR internally.
Examples:
Using an Algol-like manner of argument processing.
FUNCTION SUM(P1,I,N)
SUM=0.
DO I=1,N SUM=SUM+CSRPAR(1) OD
END
The comis main program
.....
LORN=1

I=1

S=SUM(A(I),I,N) END

produces

S=A(1)+A(2)+ ... +A(N)

while the program
.....
LORN=1 K=1 S=SUM(A(I,K)*B(K,J),K,M) END produces the (I,J)th inner product of A and B.
The length of the K-th argument’s text can be obtained by
L = CSLPAR

(K)

The K-th argument’s text can be moved into a variable of character type by

23
CALL CSTPAR

(K,CHARVAR)

The code of the K-th argument with the mode ”sequence of statements” can be stored in the comis
internal buffer as the comis routine with given name NAME by
CALL CSSPAR

CSSPAR(K,’NAME’,IADP)

where output parameter IADP is the address of the comis routine.
